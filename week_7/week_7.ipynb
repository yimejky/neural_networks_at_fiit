For example, in images there is a spatial relation between individual pixel -- we can not arbitrarily mix them, their position relative to each other is important.\n",

    "- __Kernel size:__ How large is the sliding windows that slides across the image. We usually use square sized windows with _odd_ and relatively small size, e.g. $3 \\times 3$ or $5 \\times 5$. We use odd size for the sake of symmetry. $1 \\times 1$ is a special case called $1 \\times 1$ convolution. In that case each value only depends on the values of one specific pixel. However, we still combine the channels of said input pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Stride:__ Stride is the size of the step that the sliding window takes, i.e. how much does the window moves. Usually we use $1 \\times 1$ stride, so we move by one pixel in both direction. With this stride the resolution of the output is the same as the resolution of the input. With bigger stride the resolution get smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Padding:__ We need to decide how to handle the edges of the image. If we center the $3 \\times 3$ window on a top left pixel, parts of the window will overhang. Two basic strategies are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. We pad the image with zero values.\n",
    "  2. We only move the window so that it fits the image.\n",

    "  \n",

    "### Convolutional layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional layers consist of multiple convolutional neurons. Each neuron creates its own output matrix - called a _channel_. If we start with a $256 \\times 256$ image with 3 channels (RGB), the shape of this image is $256 \\times 256 \\times 3$. After we process it with 100 convolutional neurons, we get 100 new channels. The shape of the output of such convolutional layer is $256 \\times 256 \\times 100$. Each neuron looks at the same windows, but each neuron has its own parameters (weights and bias) and the activation values they calculate for their channels are therefore different.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of weight parameter in a convolutional layer can be calculated as $K \\times C_i \\times C_o$, where $K$ is a kernel size (e.g. 9 for $3 \\times 3$ kernel), $C_i$ is number of channels on input and $C_o$ is number of channels on output or number (which is the same as number of neurons in the layer. If we have $3 \\times 3$ kernel with 100 neurons over RGB image, the number of parameters in that layer is 2700. The next layer with 100 neurons would have $3 \\times 3 \\times 100 \\times 100 = 90,000$ parameters. We omitted bias parameters, but each neuron has one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Max-pooling layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from convolutional layers, convolutional neural networks also contain max-pooling layers. These layers are very simple, we split each channel into small windows called _pools_, e.g. with a size of $2 \\times 2$. From each pool we select only the maximum value. We construct new channel from these maxima:\n",
    "\n",
    "ILL\n",
    "\n",
    "Max-pooling layers also have stride, similarly to convolutional layers. When we have the same stride as pool size, we reduces the dimensionality of the tensors in the network, e.g. we reduce $256 \\times 256 \\times 100$ into $128 \\times 128 \\times 100$ with $2 \\times 2$ pools and $2 \\times 2$ strides. But it also effectively increases the receptive field of the neurons:\n",
    "\n",
    "ILL\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep networks, the receptive fields of the neurons from the later layers consist of the entire input image. Because each max-pooling halves width and height we usually use images with powers of two as dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs consist of convolutional and max-pooling layers. Then the final layers are _dense_, i.e. the layers we used in MLP. The illustration below shows how convolutional neural network usually looks like. This is an architecture called VGG-16 [1]:\n",

    "You can see that CNNs are quite deep compared to MLP. Notice how the number of channels grow as the size of the image shrinks. This pyramid shape is how CNNs are usually designed. VGG-16 is quite popular architecture that is still used in practice as a baseline solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Exercise 7.2:__ Check [this online visualization](https://scs.ryerson.ca/~aharley/vis/conv/) of how a very simple CNN works on a digit recognition task. Try to identify the basic parts we talked about so far - channel, convolutional layer, max pooling layer, dense layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training convolutional neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are trained in the same way as the other neural networks we have seen so far, i.e. via _stochastic gradient descent_. Each neuron has a set of parameters and we calculate the derivative for each of these parameters w.r.t. defined loss function. The training is not so different from a MLP training, because convolution can be in fact [rewritten as matrix multiplication](https://github.com/alisaaalehi/convolution_as_multiplication), which is the basic operation of MLP as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is interesting to think about what exactly are neurons learning in CNNs. The convolutional layers are quite small compared to dense layers and the neurons are always looking at just small windows. How is it possible that they can process images so well? The illustration below shows, what are neurons at individual layers learning:\n",

    "\n",
    "We can see that the bottom-most layers are learning only very rudimentary patterns - edges, corners, etc. As we go further in the network, the neurons are combining what the neurons from previous layers learned and they become sensitive to more and more complex patterns. Finally the neurons in final layers are sensitive to very high-level patterns, e.g. pictures of dogs. I recommend checking the paper [2] to see some additional visualizations.\n",

    "#### 1D and 3D convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have discussed only 2D convolution. The input has two dimensions - width and height - and for each pixel we have several channels. We can use the same principle in 1D case, e.g. we can have a time series where each point in time has several features - channels. The 1D convolution is very similar to 2D convolution, but instead of 2D convolutional kernels, 2D channels, 2D pools we have all these concepts in 1D. E.g. we will have a kernel size 5 that can see 5 steps in the time series. 1D convolution can be used to model time series, sounds, text and other sequential data. Similarly, we can have CNNs that can process 3D data, these are for example used in biomedicine for drug analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "_Bias_ and _variance_ are two very important machine learning concepts. Bias in this context is not a neuron parameter. Bias is a train set error. High bias means that we can not fit the train data very well. In Exercise 7.3 we have seen a training that was able to fit the training data with almost 100% accuracy. The bias of this model is very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance on the other hand is a test set error. It is the difference between train and test set data. In 7.3 the test set only achieved accuracy of about 91%. The 9% difference between train and test set performance is the variance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Regularization_ is a term used for various techniques that reduce the _variance_ of the model. By reducing variance we often increase the bias - this is often referred to as a _bias-variance trade-off_. We try to tune the variance and bias so that we get the best possible test set results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not explain in detail how individual regularization techniques work here. You can check the further reading section for in-depth explanation. Instead, we will shortly review how to apply common techniques in TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### L2  and  L1 regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Both L2 and L1 aim to reduce the magnitude of parameters. Each training step, optimizer calculates the gradient for each parameter. On top of that, both L2 and L1 slightly push each parameter towards the zero. This is based around the observation, that the parameters with high magnitude lead to unstable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 and L1 regularizators are applied on layers with trainable parameters, e.g. Dense and ConvXD layers. You can apply them simply by using the `x_regularizer` parameter during their initialization. Check the documentation of these layers for more detail. We usually apply these regularizators only on weights (weights are also called `kernel`) and not on biases. L2 is used more often than L1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tf.keras.regularizers import l1, l2\n",
    "\n",
    "dense = Dense(\n",
    "    units=64, \n",
    "    activation='relu,\n",
    "    kernel_regularizer=l2(l=0.01),  # l is lambda, how strong the regularizer is\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout randomly turns off certain number of neurons in a layer. This helps with generalization, because the model can not rely on a specific values from specific neurons. Instead, each neuron needs to be able to contribute to the result. Dropout is usually used only after _dense_ layers. It is implemented as `keras` Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tf.keras.layers import Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "dense = Dense(\n",
    "    units=64, \n",
    "    activation='relu)\n",
    "dropout = Dropout(\n",
    "    rate=0.5)  # How many neurons are turned off\n",
    "    \n",
    "x = dense(x)\n",
    "x = dropout(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch normalization is a controversial technique. It empirically improves the results, but researchers are not quite sure why. We simply normalize each activation value within a batch. I.e. when we have a 200 neurons in a dense layer, we calculate the mean and variance of output for each neuron. Then we use these quantities to normalize the output. We can use batch normalization after both dense and convolutional layers\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from tf.keras.layers import BatchNormalization\n",
    "\n",
    "dense = Dense(\n",
    "    units=64, \n",
    "    activation='relu)\n",
    "batchnorm = BatchNormalization()\n",
    "    \n",
    "x = dense(x)\n",
    "x = batchnorm(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "All the regularization methods above introduce additional hyperparameters. Lambda `l` for L2 and L1, `rate` for dropout and [multiple hyperparameters](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization) for batch normalization. Similarly to other hyperparameters these need to be tuned as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda `l` is usually set to a small number, I would consider exponentially search through $\\langle 10^{-4}, 10^{-2}$ range. For dropout rate a number from $\\langle 0.1, 0.5$ range is usually used. I would typically use the default values for batch normalization, but you can tune them as well. L2/L1 is not as popular as it once was, because it is quite sensitive to how we set the lambda hyperparameter. Nowadays most people use either dropout and batch normalization as a single technique for their model.\n",
    "\n",

The model is big enough to learn from the data and the training is quite stable. Next, we should focus on improving the performance for test set.
